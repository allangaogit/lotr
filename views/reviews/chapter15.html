                    Elrond has sent elves and rangers to scout the whereabouts of the ringwraiths, although their horses were taken by the flood and ghouly garments washed away as well, the riders are not so easily disposed of. With them on the loose, the fellowship will always have peril and danger marching close by.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So the fellowship stays at Rivendells for months until they gather enough information that the ringwraiths are no longer close by, likely back to the Dark Lord waiting for more orders and recovering, planning. Whatever it is, it is not until the dead of winter the fellowship decides it is safe to travel south again.

                    To match the likes of the nine black riders The fellowship composes 9 brave souls: Frodo (the ringbearer), Sam (Frodo’s sidekick), Pippin (the guy the likes to complain and sing), Merry (gets less characterization than Pippin so far so I don’t know what to say here), Gandalf (Wisebrows as I call him now ever since learning about the absolute unit of his eyebrows that go past the brim of his hat, and a representative of the Free Peoples of the World: Elves - Legolas (part-time Pirate Will Turner), Dwarves - Gimli (and my axe!), Men - Aragorn (Strider) and Boromir (Sean Bean, I know you die).

                </p>
                <p>
                    Aragorn’s broken sword is reforged by the elvish blacksmiths (wait are elvish smiths better than dwarven smiths? I get the feeling from popular culture that dwarves are better smiths, but it seems like elves are superior in LOTR). Once called the sword of Elendil, the newly reforged sword is now called Anduril, Flame of the West.


                </p>
                <p>
                    Before the fellowship sets off, Bilbo gives Frodo his heirlooms, the equipment he used when he traveled with the dwarven company and faced Smaug. He gives Frodo his chainmail and sword - Sting.


                </p>
                <p>
                    Legolas has an elven sword named Glamdring. But Gimil’s broadaxe is described is not given a name? Hmm


                </p>

                    As they travel south they are often encountering large flocks of birds, flying, circling, and wheeling, as if looking for something. Aragorn says that they are likely the allies of Sauron. Truly the dark lord has great power to wield when he can assemble and deploy large swaths of drones to look for the fellowship and the ring.

                    Ok, Tolkien, nice of you to flex your linguistic skills, but you’re hurting my third-grade reading level brain. He goes on to explain how a mountain that our fellowship is climbing is called Caradhras, aka the Redhorn aka Barazinbar, one of the tallest peaks of the Misty Mountains and one of the Mountains of Moria. I’m getting a lot of lore and names thrown at me, some of which refer to the same thing but in different languages like Elvish, Dwarven, or Men. I’m getting Game of Thrones Meereen vibes when names like Hizdahr zo Loraq or Zharaq zo Loraq and all the names make me mix up who’s who and what’s what. Maybe I need to take better notes rather than just typing out my stream of consciousness.

                </p>
                <p>
                    As they go down a treacherous path up the mountain walking by the cliff, the snowfall grows and the wind grows fierce. They are forced to go back down as this way is not possible with these conditions.
