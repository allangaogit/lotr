            <div class="container">
                <p>
                    Why is Aragorn called Strider? All I can imagine is that when he walks he takes these big long strides like he’s trying un-wedgie himself without using his hands.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Strider talks with Frodo as promised. He offers to share what he knows with Frodo, but only for a price. Frodo, lacking money, is worried if he has enough to satisfy the rogue’s demands. To his surprise, Strider’s only ask is that he travels along with Frodo.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Strider tells the hobbits that he eavesdropped on their conversation on their way to Bree. He learned of Frodo’s identity and followed him to the Prancing Pony. Mysterious black riders have come and go and Frodo has not been nearly cautious enough to hide his trail.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Strider mentions a particular local, Bill Ferny, who was there when Frodo disappeared and left the inn in a hurry with an outsider. Bill is known to be a rascal, willing to sell out secrets and backstab others for his own gain. Strider fears that Frodo’s magical act at the inn will attract unwanted guests.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once again, had I not been privy to the immense pop culture that is Lord of the Rings, I would be terribly suspicious of Strider at this point. A mysterious man warns our naive gang of four hobbits about the lands outside the shire, the black riders, and the Enemy. He wants to help us and lead us to Rivendell. All this sounds too good to be true and a surefire trap for our hobbits to fall into.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mr. Butterbur comes in to help with the amenities. Strider hides, going into a dark corner. Butterbur promised Frodo a private talk as well. He guesses Frodo’s true identity and after much conversation, we learn that Gandalf arrived at the Prancing Pony three months ago asking Butterbur to deliver a message to Frodo. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    That message was never sent due to circumstance, but now we learn that Gandalf finds himself busy with troubling news. He tells Frodo to trust both Butterbur and Strider as they are allies to our group’s cause. The hobbits must make haste toward Rivendell and should Gandalf not be present, hopefully, Elrond, Elf Agent Smith, can help them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With a final P.S. Gandalf warns Frodo to not use the ring and not travel by night.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Strider formally introduces himself: </br>

I am Aragorn son of Arathorn; and if by life or death I can save, I will.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Aragorn steals the spotlight in his scenes. Also has decent comedy chops calling Sam ‘you are one stout fellow.’ My boy, Sam, indeed enjoys his beer. </br>
                </p>
                <pre>
                    “All that is gold does not glitter,
                    Not all those who wander are lost;
                    The old that is strong does not wither,
                    Deep roots are not reached by the frost.

                    From the ashes a fire shall be woken,
                    A light from the shadows shall spring;
                    Renewed shall be blade that was broken,
                    The crownless again shall be king.”

            </pre>
                <p>
                    Not sure what it all means, but it has significance to Aragorn.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aragorn pulls out his sword, I want to keep calling him Strider cause it’s faster to write but I digress, and reveals that his sword is broken a foot below the hilt. Strider says that it ‘shall be forged anew’ soon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aragorn really goes hard on being the mysterious dude that says vague hints.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Merry returns, frantically and out of breath. He shares that Black Riders have been wandering outside. Aragorn advises the hobbits to get some rest and leave first thing in the morning. They will have a long trek to Rivendell and they ought to be safe in the inn since the black riders do not like the light or populated areas. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The black rider modus operandi is spreading terror and fear, and only when desperate will they bypass these restrictions. They also seem dementor-like. Merry was near a black rider and felt his essence drain like he fell into a deep pool.
